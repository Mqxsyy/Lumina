Compared to other engines such as Unity and Unreal, vfx creation in roblox is pretty limited, having only beams and an image based particle emitter. Everything else to do with VFX must be manually scripted.
<br><br>
The aim of this project is to improve vfx creation in roblox by making a much more powerful particle API and to largely reduce the needs of scripting by including a simple node based UI.

### Disclaimer:

This is currently heavily work in progress, I do not recommend using this in production since everything is still subject to change.
<br> <br>
It may also be buggy and due to reasons the text inputs are scuffed.
